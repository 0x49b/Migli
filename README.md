# Migli

Migli is the virtual Assistent for your next shopping trip to your local Migros. You don't find any item in the Store and there is no Staff Member around who you can ask? Just take your Smartphone out of your pocket and start Migli. He will guide you to the products you are serching and speed up your grocery shopping.

## How it works
It is possible to sesrch by Speech-to-text or by using the keyboard. Over the Products API will be a search performed for Products by a Keyword, like `IceTea`. The Customer can then select the Product in a List and an AR View will be opened to guide the Customer trough the store, like it is well known in navigation devices in cars. 

## What will be needed in the future to make Migli possible in Stores
To locate a customer in Store there must be a Beacon Network. Paired with the In-Store Layout Migli can Guide Customers to the Products they are searching. 

## What is further possible, some Ideas
* Customer Feedback
* Better planning of stores to prevent jams
* Optimizing Store layouts
* enhance the overall shopping experience
* happy customers who will return to the store
* Gamification for a sometimes boring task of groceries shopping

## Team
Migli is brought to you by Team Lichtwellenreiter [Roger Kreienbühl & Florian Thiévent], developed at the 2020 HackZurich Hackaton.
